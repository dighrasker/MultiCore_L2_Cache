/*
- Address Read: Master tells slave what address it is trying to read
    - `ARADDR`: Address to read from
    - `ARVALID`: Asserted by L2 cache when request is ready
    - `ARREADY`: Asserted by DRAM when it's ready to accept
    - `ARSIZE`, `ARBURST`, `ARLEN`: Control signals defining burst size, type, and length
- Read Data: Slave gives master the data it wants to read
    - `RDATA`: Data returned from DRAM
    - `RVALID`: Asserted by DRAM when data is valid
    - `RREADY`: Asserted by L2 cache when itâ€™s ready to accept
    - `RLAST`: Marks the final beat in a burst
    - `RRESP`: Response status (e.g., OKAY or SLVERR)
- Address Write: Master tells slave what address it is trying to write to
    - `AWVALID`, `AWREADY`: Same handshake pattern
    - `AWSIZE`, `AWBURST`, `AWLEN`: Similar to `AR` channel
- Write Data: Master gives slave the data it is trying to write
    - `WDATA`: Data to write
    - `WSTRB`: Byte-wise write enables
    - `WVALID`, `WREADY`: Handshake
    - `WLAST`: Final beat of burst
- Write Response: Slave tells master if it successfully received the new data
    - `BRESP`: Status of write
    - `BVALID`, `BREADY`: Standard handshake
